        p Graphviz is a graph vizualization markup language - sort of like markdown for diagrams
        p Etherpad is a realtime collaborative text editor, like Google Docs. Anyone viewing the same Etherpad as you will see theirs updated in realtime for every change you make.
        p REPL stands for 'Read Evaluate Print Loop' - it's a computery jargony term that sorta means the code runs as you write it (as opposed to being 'compiled' - although graphviz is technically compiled).
      .col-md-4
        p Every change you make to the etherpad document (left pane) auto-generates a graphviz diagram (right pane).
        p Each 'room' on graphviz-repl matches an etherpad document with the same name.
        p Graphviz has 5 different styles of layout. The most popular/common is 'dot' and that's the default. To try the others, toggle the 'Layout' above.
