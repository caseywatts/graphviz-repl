        p Etherpad is a realtime collaborative text editor, like Google Docs. Anyone viewing the same Etherpad as you will see theirs updated in realtime for every change you make.

        p Graphviz is a graph vizualization markup language - sort of like markdown for diagrams
        p Graphviz has 5 different styles of layout. The most popular/common is 'dot' and that's the default. To try the others, toggle the 'Layout' above.

        h2 REPL
        p REPL stands for 'Read Evaluate Print Loop' - it's a computery jargony term that sorta means the code runs as you write it (as opposed to being 'compiled' - although graphviz is technically compiled).
        p Our REPL here is javascript in the browser that checks for changes multiple times each second. If there are changes, we ask our server to render the new image for you.
        p Every change you make to the etherpad document (left pane) auto-generates a graphviz diagram (right pane).
